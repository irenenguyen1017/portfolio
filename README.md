[Github Repo] (https://github.com/irenenguyen1017/portfolio)

==========================

## Purpose

The purpose of this website is to showcase my skills as a junior web developer to prospective employers. I have tried to use all my current to create an attractive website that is accessible to all responsive layouts.

## Functionality / Features

The website has a simple layout and doesn't use too many colours. However, it runs smoothly on different devices. I also added some animations to make the site more attractive. All pages have sidebar menu that navigates audience to other pages and links to my social accounts.

- Homepage: Includes my portrait, name, greeting, brief introduction and a link to a resume at the end.
- About me: Telling more details about personal story.
- Projects: Listed my projects and the links to my repositories in github.com.(Will be added later).
- Blogs: Linking to different blogs, a familiar link to the previous or next blog at the end of each blog.
